Welcome to letspaint. 

When playing this game you will be able to use your imagination to come up with designs and drawings using basic figures like circles, rectangles, lines, and polygons. 

Here's how to play:

Once you run the python file a graphical window will open. Once the window opens you will be presented with a series of instructions. 

You'll start by pressing the letter which indicates the figure you want to draw. 

Then, using your mouse you will click on the desired points of the window indicating the size of the figure you are drawing.

Your drawing will appear; now choose one of the options from the instructions to color the figure you just drawn. 

Finally, you will be asked if you wish to continue drawing or if you wish the exit the program. 

This game incorporates functions and loop statements. This helps the user experience in selecting from the options and for the program to decide what to do next. 
The design and algorithm of this game is based on these functions and loop statements to step by step create drawings on the graphical window in a simple and staight forward manner.
